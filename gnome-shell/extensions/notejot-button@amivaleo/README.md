# Notejot Button

A button to easily open notejot.

## Installation

You have to manually install Notejot from Software Center, either from the distribution repo or from flathub.

The extension **has not** been tested with a manual build of notejot repo: https://github.com/lainsce/notejot

You can then automatically install the extension or you can download the files and being nerdish! :D


**Automatic installation (best option):**

* From gnome extension website


**Manual installation:**

* Download the zip file
* Unzip it 
* Put the folder in `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/`
* Restart the gnome shell environnment (reboot, logout and login again, or `alt+f2` then write `r` and press enter).
