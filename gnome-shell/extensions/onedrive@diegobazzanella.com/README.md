# One Drive gnome shell extension

This is a Gnome Shell extension I use as frontend for the unofficial abraunegg onedrive client (https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive) on my desktop. 

# Features

One Drive Gnome Shell Extension can: 

- check that systemctl and onedrive are installed;
- start and stop oneddrive as user service;
- show the status of the abraunegg onedrive service;
- show an icon on the system tray (changing color if service is disabled, active o "in sync");
- show One Drive local folder;
- show emblems on One Drive local folder;
- open One Drive web site;
- perform authentication via graphical gtk interactive dialog;

# Install

Install the client. Detailed instructions here: https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md (on recent Ubuntu simpli write in a terminal "sudo apt-get install onedrive").

Go to gnome shell extensione page (https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3919/one-drive/) and install it. You have to make login and activate the service via extension. That's all!

# Missing

Lots of things... but I'm working on it!
